              Zaamom, born in September 1987 in Morocco, was greatly inspired by
              art from a young age. He grew up in the Ocean neighborhood of
              Rabat. Seawater became ink for his drawings and waves, a source of
              inspiration for his work as well as a playground for his favorite
              sport: bodysurfing. After studying contemporary literature, Zaamom
              attended art classes, taking part in many professional events in
              both artistic and athletic fields.

              He stands out for his particular drawing and painting style that
              coordinates forms, sizes and colours in an innovative way,
              inspired by the colorful underwater world and the rhythm of the
              tides. He is now regarded as one of the most influential street
              artists in Morocco, and that, since 2012. With that same number 12
              on his shirt, he's been crowned as a bodysurf national champion.
