                In visual arts, music and other media, minimalism is an art movement that began in postâ€“World War II in
                Western art,
                most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with
                minimalism
                include Donald Judd, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt and Frank
                Stella.[2][3] The
                movement is often interpreted as a reaction against abstract expressionism and modernism; it anticipated
                contemporary
                postminimal art practices, which extend or reflect on minimalism's original objectives.

                Minimalism in music often features repetition and gradual variation, such as the works of La Monte
                Young, Terry Riley,
                Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Julius Eastman and John Adams. The term minimalist often colloquially refers
                to anything or
                anyone that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the plays
                and novels of
                Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson, the stories of Raymond Carver, and the automobile designs
                of Colin Chapman.
                The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the
                Russian painter
                Kasimir Malevich, Black Square
